# What's the Damage
The project "What's the Damage" is a simple spending analysis tool that helps to identify where money is being spent in order to provide insight for planning a basic budget while incorporating savings.

## Technical Approach
The expense tracker is purely browser based. It doesn't depend on an API or backend database. It simple reads a CSV file and breaks down the expenses into categories. Over time expenses can be tracked against a budget by simply uploading a CSV-based statement.

The budget is saved into local storage.

As the user categorises transactions, similar transactions are automatically categorised. Patterns to identify similar transactions are stored in local storage for the future.

Material UI leverages to put the primary focus on the functionality rather than the cosmetics.

While the `app` is the only package in the project, I still maintain a mono-repo style in order to possibly accommodate a server application or component library in the future.

## Background
What fills me with a sense of accomplishment about this project is the fact that it embodies what I believe to be the essence of programming – translating abstract ideas into impactful, tangible solutions to real-world problems. This project also reflects my growth and maturation as a developer over the years.

Two years ago, I would have approached this differently. I would have spent months obsessing over the perfect implementation, creating an intricate plan and striving for perfection in each line of code. Today, however, faced with a problem that needed immediate resolution, I chose a different path.

I recognized the urgency of the situation and prioritized solving the problem efficiently, creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that was functional and effective. This approach wasn't about compromising code quality, but about finding a balance. It was about accepting that "perfect" code is often the enemy of good, practical solutions.

Every line of code written reflects this mindset – not a pursuit of perfection, but an endeavor to build a usable application that serves its purpose and can be improved over time. This doesn't mean quality was overlooked. I aimed for clean, readable code – functional, maintainable, and scalable. I view the areas that can be improved not as flaws, but as opportunities for continuous learning and refinement.

In essence, my pride in this code stems from its capacity to solve problems, simplify life, and testify to the creative power of technology. Every time I use my expense tracker, I see a real-life problem that's been solved and a process that's been made more efficient. I see a solution that I created from scratch, and it serves as a reminder of why I am so passionate about programming.

I've matured as a programmer, and this project is a testament to that growth. It's not just about the code or the problem solved – it's about the journey of iterative development, of recognizing the importance of delivering effective solutions quickly, and learning to strike a balance between function and form. And it's this balance, this growth, and the ability to adapt that makes me truly proud of the work I've done.
